The Project Parameters dialog is enabled by adding two actions to the Records Management Policy:

 - "View Project Parameters" - Adding this action to the policy will cause a button to appear at 
    the bottom of the VERA Action Menu to "View Project Parameters".  This will provide users with 
    the ability to view the current configuration of parameters defined by the project's Project 
    Parameter Policy file.  This will be a read-only (non-editable) view of the parameters.

 - "Configure Project Parameters":  Adding this action to the policy will cause a button to appear 
    at the bottom of the VERA Action Menu to "Configure Project Parameters".  This will provide 
    users with the ability to both view and edit the configuration of parameters defined by the 
    project's Project Parameter Policy file.

    NOTE: Users will be able to edit the current value of each parameter, but they will not be able
    to add or remove parameters from the project.

These actions can be added independently or together, and their availability is controlled 
independently.  That is, you can configure whether certain user groups will see one of the two 
actions, both actions, or neither actions.

If these actions are enabled without also including a Project Parameter Policy file, then an empty 
dialog will be displayed.

If a Project Parameter Policy file is used without enabling these actions, then the parameters in 
the policy will be used by VERA, but they will not be viewable or editable except by opening the
policy file directly.
