# VERA Configuration Cookbook & Wiki
Welcome to the VERA Configuration Cookbook repository.  This repository contains references and examples to aid VERA policy administrators in configuring their VERA policy files.

---
_**Note**:  Both the repository and the wiki are under-construction, and Tx3 is actively working to create new content.  However, we welcome requests for specific topics or examples that you would find helpful.  This will help us to prioritize our work.  [Request an update](https://github.com/Tx3-Services/VERA-Configuration-Cookbook#requesting-updates) using the repository's Issues feature.  Thanks!_

## Overview
This material is divided in two sections:
1. **VERA Configuration Cookbook** (*git repository*):  A collection of file snippets that provide examples of various configurations within VERA.
2. **VERA Configuration Wiki**:  A collection of help pages providing instructions for configuring and using VERA policy files.


## VERA Configuration Cookbook
The Configuration Cookbook is a git repository containing collections of file snippets--or _recipes_--that demonstrate different use cases for configuring VERA.

The repository is organized into a folder structure where each folder contains its own recipe.  The folder name will describe the use case demonstrated by the recipe.  Each recipe consists of one or more VERA policy files that contain example configurations for implementing the use case.  The policy files are only snippets with enough configurations to illustrate the use case; they are not fully configured policy files.  Users can copy and modify the examples contained in a recipe to apply them to their own VERA configurations.

The cookbook can be browsed online directly within GitHub, or users can download the examples locally by cloning the repository on their machine.  Users are also free to fork the repository in order to create specialized documentation for their organization.

## VERA Configuration Wiki
The [Configuration Wiki](https://github.com/Tx3-Services/VERA-Configuration-Cookbook/wiki) supports the Configuration Cookbook by providing instructions and best practices for configuring policy files.  For example, users can reference the wiki for details on the correct structure and formatting of configuration elements found in the recipes of the cookbook.

## Asking Questions
Configuration questions can be asked by submitting an [Issue](https://github.com/Tx3-Services/VERA-Configuration-Cookbook/issues) that is tagged with the `question` label.

Before submitting a question, please try searching the existing issues to see if another user has already asked the same question.  If you find that your question has already been asked, we encourage you to comment on the existing question rather than submitting a new one.  This sort of dialog will provide the most benefit to all users.

## Reporting Issues
If you find a mistake or inaccuracy in any of the examples or help documentation, then please submit an [Issue](https://github.com/Tx3-Services/VERA-Configuration-Cookbook/issues) that is tagged with the `bug` label.

## Requesting Updates
We welcome requests for specific examples or help content.  Updates can be requested by submitting an [Issue](https://github.com/Tx3-Services/VERA-Configuration-Cookbook/issues) that is tagged with the `enhancement` label.

Before submitting a new request, please try searching the existing issues to see if another user has already requested the same update.  If you find that your update has already been requested by another user, it is best to up-vote (+1) the existing request  rather than submitting a new one.  This will help us to better prioritize your request.
